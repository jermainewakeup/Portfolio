    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>I am an artist at heart and am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science in hopes to one day create my own virtual instruments. I've been creating music for the past 9 years, and the idea of expressing myself in new ways is what keeps me coming back and what has lead me to want to create tools to help me accomplish that, whatever they may be.</p>
